DESCRIPTION:

A computer is a great thing. It helps us store and manage tons of information. Every user knows how to work with folders. In this step, we will learn how to get a list of files and folders within a specific directory.

OBJECTIVES:

In this stage, your program should:

Accept a command-line argument that is a root directory with files and folders. Print Directory is not specified if there is no command-line argument;

Iterate over folders and print file names with their paths. The direction of the slashes in the printed out paths do not matter. Tests are platform 

independent, so different style of slashes ("/" or "\") are valid.
